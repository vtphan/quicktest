quicktest.py is a short Python script that facilitates very simple testing of program.

TEST_FILE_INDEX lists all indices that define the difference between your test data. 

Examples:

```
	TEST_FILE_INDEX = [1,2,3,4,5]    #indices of 5 data points
	TEST_FILE_INDEX = range(1,11)    #indices of 10 data points, starting from 1 ending at 10	
```

CMD is the command that runs your program.  In CMD, replace the index with "{0}".
